Isamode --   (Obsolete) GNU Emacs support for Isabelle 
------------------------------------------------------

Isamode provides facilities for interacting with Isabelle and editing
theory files, inside GNU Emacs.

This is an archive of this old code in case anyone needs to ressurect
a version of the Isabelle theorem prover from the 1990s (to run with a
matching old version of Emacs or XEmacs).

The final distribution was Isamode-2.7, distributed in 2000.
