              Isamode -- GNU Emacs support for Isabelle

                    Installation Instructions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Isamode 2.7 has been designed for use with Isabelle99.

This means there is little configuration needed since the 'isatool'
script provides the settings and functions Isamode needs.

Here's what to do:

1. Unpack the distribution Isamode.tar.gz somewhere suitable.
   The recommended place is $ISABELLE_HOME/contrib/Isamode, where
   $ISABELLE_HOME is the root of your Isabelle installation.

2. You don't need to edit any elisp, provided:

     (i) $ISAMODE_HOME is correctly configured in the Isabelle
         settings file and you use $ISAMODE_HOME/elisp as the
	 installation directory for elisp files;
    (ii) When you start Emacs, 'isatool' is on the PATH, or
         you use the generic interface wrapper 'Isabelle'
         provided in Isabelle99 to start-up (in the latter case make
         sure that ISABELLE_INTERFACE=emacs is configured in the
         settings).

   Otherwise, there are two variables you must set in the file
   elisp/isa-site.el,

      isa-isatool-command
        Should be set to full name of 'isatool', $ISABELLE_HOME/bin/isatool.

      isa-elisp-dir
        Should be set to the installation directory of the elisp
        files.

    Instead of editing isa-site.el, these variables could be set in
    .emacs or the site-wide Emacs initialization files.

3. If you want to compile the Emacs lisp files, edit the Makefile
   appropriately.  It also has targets for installing files, which you
   may wish to use if the elisp files have to be installed somewhere
   different.  You may also want to build and install the info
   documentation files.
   IMPORTANT NOTE:  to allow the defaults for variables to be
   recalculated each time Isamode is entered, it is recommended that
   you DELETE the compiled files isa-site.elc and isa-load.elc.

4. You can activate Isamode in a fresh Emacs session using the generic
   interface wrapper 'Isabelle' provided in Isabelle 94-8.  Otherwise,
   you may like to make Isamode available to any Emacs session.  To do
   this you must add this line to your .emacs or site-wide
   initialisation:

         (load-file "<path>/isa-site")

   Where <path> is the path to where you installed the elisp files
   (perhaps $ISAMODE_HOME/elisp if you did not need to move them).

5. You may want to customize Isamode to your preferences.  There are
   numerous user options. You can list them in the usual way, with M-x
   list-options.  Many of the user-customizable variables are declared
   in isa-load.el (but set them using setq's in your .emacs file).
   For more details, see the Isamode documentation.
   
6. Isamode documentation.  There is a TeXinfo file and Makefile in the
   directory doc/.  Provided you have the appropriate tools, you can
   build info, dvi or HTML files from this source.  If you do not have
   the tools, you can find dvi and HTML versions of the documentation
   on my web page,

      http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/da/Isamode.html
      http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/da/Isamode.dvi.gz
      
   To install the info files you will need to copy them to somewhere
   on the Emacs Info-directory-list path, or add the doc directory to
   that list, with:

     (setq Info-directory-list
	   (cons "$ISAMODE_HOME/doc" Info-directory-list))

   (substitute the angle brackets for the real pathname).
