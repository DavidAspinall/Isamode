Summary of Recent Changes to Isamode
====================================

Last updated: March 2000.


Version 2.7 (March 2000)
-------------------------

** Fixed patch for Isabelle99.

** Updated dates in documentation.

** Updated support for theory files, some new keywords added.


Version 2.6p3 (January 2000)
----------------------------

** Patch for Isabelle99, supplied by Markus Wenzel.


Version 2.6
-----------
** Updated for Isabelle94-8 release, and recent versions of Emacs.
   Tested on Xemacs 19.15 and FSF GNU Emacs 19.34.

    * Uses 'isatool' program to run Isabelle, find logics and
      documentation.  This means that the following variables are now
      *obsolete*: isa-logic-paths, isa-ml-compiler, isa-manual-path,
      isa-view-man-command, isa-user-prologue (replaced by
      isa-session-prelude).  There is a new variable
      isa-ruletable-paths which contains a list of directories to
      search for ruletables.

    * The menus have been slightly rearranged and extended,
      and some of the functions have been updated.
      Some short-cut keybindings have changed to be easier.
      The use file functions now do something sensible inside
      the Isabelle buffer.
      
    * The theory file editing mode has been simplified, mainly to
      remove the code for automatically inserting backslashes in
      strings, since this is no longer required by the Isabelle theory
      file syntax.  The variables isa-theory-indent-factors,
      isa-thy-rigid-backslash-left, isa-theory-rigid-backslash-right,
      have been removed.

      At least some of the new headings are included in the list of
      known keywords, but they are not dealt with in templates at the
      moment.

      Fontification is now included by default, so there is
      NO NEED for  (require 'isa-fonts)  and that file has gone.

    * The functions isa-batchify and isa-unbatchify have been
      modified to produce goal...qed and qed_goal proofs.
      (They're still as fussy about the proof formats as before, though)

    * Frame properties have been repaired (broken by Emacs
      changes/bugs).   See isa-multi-frame-display-props in
      isa-load.el.

    * The special faces (e.g. ruletableGroupname) used by Isamode in
      ruletables and proofstates are now only partially supported ---
      they are still used, but no attempt is made to make them appear
      in a special way inside Isamode.  In the future they may be
      dropped altogether in favour of font-lock, which is easier to
      use and provides a (slightly) more consistent interface across
      Emacs versions.  

    * In XEmacs, as you move the mouse over rule names in rule tables,
      the tactic that would be run by button2 is displayed in the
      minibuffer.  This also works in FSF Emacs, if you set the variable
      isa-track-mouse to t.  However this seems to cause a flickery
      display and slow-down, so it isn't recommended.  It would be much
      better if you switched to XEmacs, really...
